# RT-950 Pro Custom Firmware
## Why this fork?
This is an experimental fork of the Open-source bare-metal firmware for the **Radtel RT-950 Pro** handheld radio.  The original project did all the hard work, I'm just making it work on A radio without any idea whether this helps or hinders the next radio. 
- very new to this hardware and project (consider yourself warned), so this is a sandbox while I try to figure out what is wrong with my hardware that it won't run the main fork.
- hardware tests output is optionally mirrored on the serial port (DEBUG=1)
- working: flash, init, GPS data read, keypad, serial port, screen, side keys, LEDs
- not correct: tuners, audio

**Target**: Artery AT32F403A (ARM Cortex-M4F @ 120 MHz, 1 MB flash, 96 KB SRAM)

## Status

> [!WARNING]
> This is heavily work-in-progress and still is ridden with bugs. Early hardware bring-up. Boot screen, LEDs, LCD, and GPIO confirmed working on real hardware.

### Hardware Confirmed

- **LCD**: ST7789V 240x320 via 8080 parallel bus (PD0-PD15), custom text rendering
- **LEDs**: Red (PC13), Green (PC14)
- **Backlight**: Primary (PC6), Secondary (PB3)
- **Power latch**: PB9
- **Band relay**: PC4
- **Boot**: Custom firmware loads and runs via OEM bootloader

### What's Implemented (Roughly Code-Complete, Untested)

- **Hardware drivers**: GPIO, SPI2 (flash), bit-bang SPI (BK4829), bit-bang I2C (SI4732), USART1/3/UART4, ADC2, DAC1+TIM6+DMA, ST7789V LCD (8080 parallel), DMA1/DMA2
- **RF control**: Dual BK4829 transceiver driver, frequency programming, TX power levels, calibration tables from flash
- **Application layer**: Dual VFO (A/B/C), PTT with active-low relay control, keypad scanner with debounce, rotary encoder, S-meter, menu system, frequency entry
- **Digital modes**: APRS (hardware FSK via BK4829, MIC-E packets), DTMF encode/decode, CTCSS/DCS tone generation
- **Receivers**: SI4732 AM/FM/SSB broadcast radio, FM broadcast with presets, weather channels
- **Data**: SPI flash layout (990 channels, VFO configs, settings), wear-leveled NV storage, CPS programming protocol (UART4)
- **Comms**: GPS NMEA parser, Bluetooth BLE data bridge, VOX, NOAA weather radio (SI4732 WB)
- **UI**: Display rendering, splash screen, zone browser, text input, scanner, spectrum analyzer, hierarchical 12-category menu
- **Radio**: Cross-band repeat (A->B, B->A, duplex), band-specific relay routing, interrupt-driven UART
- **Safety**: PTT relay polarity verified (active-low), PA gate timing, TX band limits
- **Tools**: BTF firmware encrypt/decrypt, CPS flash read/write, firmware upload with auto-restart

### What's Not Done

- Most peripherals untested on hardware (SPI flash, BK4829, SI4732, GPS, keypad, encoder)
- Bluetooth audio streaming (AT commands only)
- Voice prompt audio samples (tone patterns only)

### Example Hardware Test

![Example Test](docs/screenshots/screenshot_1.jpg)

## Building

### Prerequisites

- `arm-none-eabi-gcc` (12.x or later)
- `python3` with `pyserial`
- `make`

### Build

```bash
make                  # Build release firmware
make DEBUG=1          # Build with debug UART output
make btf              # Generate encrypted .BTF for upload
make btf DEBUG=1      # Generate debug .BTF
make size             # Print flash/RAM usage
make clean            # Remove build artifacts
```

### Upload to Radio

```bash
# Normal upload (auto-enters bootloader via PROGRAMBT9000U handshake)
python3 tools/firmware_upload.py upload /dev/ttyUSB0 build/rt950-custom.BTF -v

# Radio already in bootloader (side buttons held at power-on)
python3 tools/firmware_upload.py upload /dev/ttyUSB0 build/rt950-custom.BTF --ptt -v

# Reset back to default firmware
python3 tools/firmware_upload.py upload /dev/ttyUSB0 binary/RT_950Pro_V0.27_260203/RT_950Pro_V0.27_260203.BTF --ptt -v
```

### Hardware Tests

```bash
make test TEST=1   # Backlight blinky
make test TEST=2   # UART echo (GPS + BT)
make test TEST=3   # LCD color bars
make test TEST=4   # BK4829 chip ID read
make test TEST=5   # SI4732 revision read
make test TEST=6   # SPI flash JEDEC ID
make test TEST=7   # ADC battery + audio
make test TEST=8   # DAC 1 kHz tone
make test TEST=9   # Keypad + encoder scan
make test TEST=10  # GPS NMEA display
make test TEST=11  # Full system diagnostic
```

### Output Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `build/rt950-custom.elf` | Linked ELF with debug symbols |
| `build/rt950-custom.bin` | Raw binary for flashing |
| `build/rt950-custom.hex` | Intel HEX for flashing |
| `build/rt950-custom.BTF` | Encrypted firmware for upload |

## Memory Layout

```
Flash:
  0x08000000  OEM Bootloader (12 KB, permanent)
  0x08003000  Custom firmware starts here <- linker ORIGIN
  0x08100000  End of flash (1 MB)

SRAM:
  0x20000000  .data + .bss + heap
  0x20017BB0  Stack top (matches OEM)
  0x20018000  End of SRAM (96 KB)
```

The bootloader only checks that `[0x08003000]` is a valid SRAM address.
**No CRC, no signature** - custom firmware is flashable via the standard OEM update tool.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tools/firmware_upload.py` | Upload .BTF firmware to radio via serial |
| `tools/encrypt_btf.py` | Encrypt/decrypt BTF firmware files |
| `tools/cps_flash.py` | Read/write radio configuration via CPS protocol |

See [tools/README.md](tools/README.md) for detailed usage and protocol documentation.

### Known BTF Encryption Keys

| Version | Key (hex) |
|---------|-----------|
| V0.15 | `71CAEFACD047EF83EFD2141A3512A638` |
| V0.18 | `DC24DEF7CF4F3FED91BCC88BB0613A51` |
| V0.21 | `3C0F640BB03230BB97AF8029C4AD794D` |
| V0.27 | `7E807B1761A4EBC6FC3A8DD33752F305` |

Keys are stored at offset 0x400 in the `.BTF` file. Use `--auto` to extract automatically.

## Key Notes

**GPIO registers**: AT32F403A uses SCR at +0x10 (set pin HIGH) and CLR at +0x14 (clear pin LOW). The OEM GPIO helpers are at 0x080155B2 (set) and 0x080155AE (clear).

**PTT relays are active-low**: All relay pins SET HIGH = deactivated (RX/idle). Pins are CLEARED to activate TX path. Wrong polarity = PA damage.

**SPI1 is unused**: Despite being a standard SPI peripheral, the OEM firmware never configures SPI1. PA7 (SPI1_MOSI) is actually the keypad latch line.

**Dual BK4829 RF chips**: Chip 0 (CS=PE8) handles main VFO, chip 1 (CS=PE15) handles sub-receiver and APRS. They share clock (PE10) and data (PE11) lines.

**Unused peripherals**: SPI1, ADC1, USART2, I2C1/I2C2 hardware, DMA2 CH1 have zero references in the OEM binary.
